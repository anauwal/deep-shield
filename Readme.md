Safeguarding Web Apps with Neural Network Vigilance

---

## Overview

DeepShield is an advanced web application security solution that utilizes the power of artificial intelligence and neural networks to protect your web applications against SQL injection attacks. By deploying this intelligent guardian, you can enhance the security of your web applications and ensure the safety of your user data.

## Features

- Utilizes state-of-the-art neural networks for real-time detection of SQL injection attacks.
- Acts as a reverse proxy, intercepting incoming requests and analyzing them for malicious intent.
- Blocks suspicious requests and prevents potential SQL injection breaches.
- Dynamically learns from attack patterns and adapts its defense strategies.
- Provides a user-friendly web interface for monitoring and management.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anauwal/deep-shield.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd deep-shield
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Train the neural network model (Refer to `trainer.py`) using your dataset of clean and malicious queries.

5. Start the DeepShield reverse proxy server:

   ```bash
   python reverse_proxy_waf.py --target YOUR_APP_ADDRESS --run 0.0.0.0 5000
   ```

6. Test the system by sending malicious queries using the `malicious_query_tester.py` script.

7. Monitor the DeepShield dashboard and logs to assess its performance.

## Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard

DeepShield now features a real-time monitoring dashboard with interactive charts. This dashboard allows you to visualize and track various metrics, including blocked IP addresses and total prevented attacks. Access the dashboard by visiting `http://localhost:5000/dashboard` in your browser after running the app.
